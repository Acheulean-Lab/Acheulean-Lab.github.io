  <H4>POOLE</H4>
  <p>

    In the evening at the king Charles pub I sat in the window with gin and listened to the murmurs of old neighbors. The rumbling of smalltalk and pleasantries over the patter of rain against the window made a warm and round tone, a well rounded sonic landscape. The fullness of the white noise, the comforting drink, and heat of the room was a in contrast to standoffishness I had felt of the bartender as I ordered with my unmistakably American voice.  Another drink, now accompanied by Jonny cash selected by the two brothers shooting pool.
    
    I overhear the bartender question the absence of another ‘If you’re going to read a book might as well do it here’. I reflected why through history so many spent their evenings at the public house, rather than home alone in the dark and damp, and I understood. Then I walked home down a lampless street through the persistent drizzle and finished my beer tout seul.
    
    On my way out the door I asked the bartender (on the street for a smoke) about the light posts, ‘Ah yeah its a dolphin.’ ‘And scallops?’ ‘yeah’, he nodded, clearly not happy chatting on his break. A woman wandered down a block past, shouting into the dead air, waving arms at nothing. 
    
    Rain crept through a crack in the window frame onto the stairs. As I sat in bed reading about the introduction of clams to the Poole harbor (inspired by the french, who needed a replacement for decimated oysters) lighting flashed white through my east window, and thunder clanged soon after. The 8 o’clock bell tolled a count 4 minutes before the hour, then again on queue. Third and fourth and fifth chimes came after in arhythmic passages, as if someone had crept into the church tower and was recalling piano lessons from childhood on a foreign keyboard.
    
    7:30 the bells have been replaced by seabirds and screeching magpies, rousing the misty dawn. A bowl of muesli and a small coffee then I head to the baiters point to try my hand at a cockle dig. A few children in uniform rush alone to school, a crew of four men in yellow suits prep their concrete truck in a blocked street, a few sailers and fisherman head to the wharf. I walk up the rocky bay, pants tucked into boots, scanning for the depressions and pinholes I had read mark buried shellfish and bivalve.

  <H4>    Stockholm Syndrome, Shelter in Place  </H4>
  <p>
     
    People say ideas always come in the shower because it’s the one time of day you aren’t on your phone. There aren’t distractions in the shower. You get lost in your thoughts, start running through imaginary situations. Too bad you don’t have your computer to write all that down. 
    
    Thoughts come in the shower with a driving, pounding motivation to act on them. The ideas excite! They demand finger drawing on the wet glass, lists and diagrams, planning is quick and fluid. This is sure to work out. But stepping out and toweling dry wipes away the urgency. Outside the shower ideas feel impossible, silly, unworthy, as if the abrasion from the towel left them worn down and beaten.    
    
    Time is abundant and it’s no trouble to fill. We’ve got more but it doesn’t go as far. Its value collapsed when it fell out of demand. Days pass so easily and so quick. The mindless daze of exercise, novels, and headlines blurs lazy mornings into early evenings. The working day shrinks to the time it takes to produce the sense of relief from the completion of one simple task. The list of ideas, projects, and to-dos grows as the stack of books shrinks. What feels good in the moment has no afterglow. The determination to do better that the resolute mind crafts each night searching for sleep cracks each morning. Now people say that this time is a gift. ‘Don’t feel the need to write that best seller, now is not the time! Use it for mental health. Use it to stay safe!’ They’re part of the problem. They hand out excuses! Time is here now, when else will it be found? 
    
    The motivation to act - to finally get to work - is only found when the fear of beginning is less than the fear of never finishing. Each night at 8 Mill Valley fills with howls. The town’s collective body morns their paused life and tries to shed frustration. Sometimes dogs punctuate human yips.

    <H4>    Vermont Pond Hockey Championship, Lake Morey Vermont  </H4>
    <p>
    
    
    Stop fuckin chirping and play the game!
    What separates the men in the bright nylon jerseys skating back and forth between the red plywood goals -
    Get off the ice! 
    from the ones who push their children in plastic carriages around the rutted grey ring that encircles the courts?
    No, you get off the ice!
    The weekend traffic reveals itself through the fresh grain of the ice. It is crosshatched and treacherous where the shore ends and countless visitors step into their balance, but pinstriped on the circuit where they begin to move in parallel. The cracks and ruts fade swiftly but before they leave they reach out to bring you down. Falling on ice occurs a process not in a moment, and the more you flail or stumble the more you drag it out
    On the outer ring, wiry figures in tight neon jackets cut through canvas coats and fraying denim pants. Jeers and cries emanate from the hockey games at eye of their path. Biker boys meet the college kind. The mental retreat of concentration on smooth motion or competition provides a cathartic release for all.

  <H4>        Two Coke Bottles, Hanover New Hampshire  </H4>
  <p>
  
    I see him now, standing with his back to the corner. Over his shoulders – which hang gauntly above my head – is draped a black coat that obscures his figure and makes him out to be as wide as a doorframe. His faded cap is pulled down low, meeting his black framed wraparound sunglasses. His high collar hides all but the tip of his nose and the tops of his flushed cheeks. 
    
    He’s got a white plastic bag with two bottles in it. I watch him drop it down onto the green lid of the trashcan in front of him as if he were at his workbench. He pulls out a bottle from the bag – a two-liter coke – and I can see that the remaining is the same. He rips off the lid and begins to drink, tossing back his head as if to pour the soda down his throat. He pauses to let the clenched bottle fall back onto the lid of the can, releasing a belch that roars through the stillness of the town green like the engines of construction equipment, and draws the rubberneck gaze of a few passersby. To me, it sounds like a scream. 
    
    He raises the bottle again, quivering as if he’s fighting some great suffocating force pulling him down. He drains the bottle and tosses it away, reaching for the second with a rigidity of motion that jerks like the hydraulic arm of an excavator. Without rest he begins to force down the second bottle, fixed to his post on the corner by the trashcans. He works with complete engagement; too absorbed in his task to notice the snickering of the girls that pass behind his back or the gawks of the children across the street.  
    
    I’ve seen him do this before. And I’ve seen him walking by the pond, and past my house. He’s always got his face wrapped up by those black frames, always walking with purpose. At the corner his task is obvious, but the motives are obscure. Presumption might suggest that it is a ritual ordained by god, a compulsion of insanity, a way to honor a lost friend or an attempt to disrupt monotony in the lives of his audience, but guessing at his purpose is futile. I know only what I can read from the way he moves. What he does is important. It is greater than himself, greater than his reputation, and greater than the force of the stares. I am awed by the ferocity with which he works.

  <H4>          Sand Only, Hanover New Hampshire  </H4>
  <p>
  
    Grey plastic waste cans lurk in dim corners, at the bottoms of seldom used stairwells, and against atrium walls through the intermittent bite of cold air. They are ever present, appearing always in the moment just after their absence is recognized. Their only engagement with the public is through frequent misidentification as a trashcan. This has necessitated the application of massive labels, which clearly state SAND ONLY in a crisp, clinical white across their lids and faces. 
    
    I see the cans in passing, note their location and quantity, but quickly lose track of their sum. It soon feels that I am surrounded. The existence of the cans begins to perplex me. What I once dismissed as some mundane tool for the grounds keeping of each building begins to gnaw at me as uncanny. Why are there so many of them? Why are they so large? Are they really for what they claim? What hides in there? The label explains a function but offers no justification. Who could possibly need so much sand? 
    
    My intrigue swells, and I become doubtful that the cans contain what they claim. I abruptly decapitate an unfortunate subject. Peeling off the lid reveals a small plastic pail, crouching at the bottom like fox defending its den. It is surrounded by a circle of debris – soda bottles, crumpled papers, gum wrappers – presumably discarded by those to disengaged to notice the prominent labels. True to its claim, the pink pail clutches a small heap of sand, but the grey plastic cavern is vast and empty around it. An image of man behind a curtain projecting a larger shadow comes to my mind.

   <h4> Busted Finger, Brandon Vermont</h4> 
   <p>
    Buddy shuts his finger in the trunk of his car and the skin splits on either side of the nail. He comes in and sits at the kitchen table with a black waterproof mitten covering his hand. He doesn’t acknowledge the mitten but when asked if he’s cold or something he says he cut his finger and it’s kinda gory. He says he’s fine, and ready to go skiing. He’s shaking. Guy asks to see it, Buddy says no, he’s fine. Guy gets him to take the mitten off and its pretty bad. The spend 20 minutes cleaning Buddy’s finger and getting bandages on it but they have a hard time because blood keeps soaking through. Buddy feels good about it and wants to go skiing. Guy says if it were him he’d be in the ER. Buddy’s finger is wrapped up like a corndog with white athletic tape and gauze down past the second knuckle. He throws a coat on grabs his ski boots and hops in the car. Turns out he was shaking so much on the way home from the parking lot he kept dropping shit and lost his keys. On the drive over Guy says he’s worried about him. 
    
    At the base Buddy needs help peeling his skins, but he just holds it out and says “pull”. He puts his skis on and takes off with everyone else uphill, chatting like nothing happened. He’s got a big smile and doesn’t speak one word about his finger the whole day. Everyone’s sort of incredulous but not really surprised because we’ve all seen him do things that should have taken him out and then seen jump back up. I once watched him try to front flip off a fence, land on his back on a berm, and slide head first into a foot of muddy water. He walked that off too. Everything is always fine with Buddy: he refuses to be a hassle, refuses to bail, refuses to get hurt.
    
    While he skins, Buddy holds his hand up across his chest. He can’t bend his finger through the bandage so if he picks anything up it looks like he’s flipping you off. He’s just got one pole and all his jackets are tied around his waist. Buddy looks like a real Vermonter, leading his sheep between pastures. He’s the first one down the hill. The next day he asks us if we think the urgent care center is open, but he won’t say what for.
